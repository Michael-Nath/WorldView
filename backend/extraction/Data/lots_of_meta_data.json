But if we get a reasonably effective vaccine of 70% to 75% and a substantial proportion of the population takes the vaccine, I think we will be going in the right direction of some degree of normality as we head into 2021 in the second, third and fourth quarter,\u201d he said.\nThe more effective the vaccine and the more people take the vaccine, the better a prospect for herd immunity, a situation in which future infection is less possible, he said.\nOnce vaccines are developed and one or more are chosen for distribution, there still may be more to learn about protecting individuals from COVID-19 with vaccines\nThe durability of immune protection is still unknown, Dr\nFauci said.\nLearn more from Dr\nMadara about why hopes for fast track to coronavirus herd immunity don\u2019t add up.\nFrom what researchers know about studies of the coronaviruses that cause the annual common cold, coronavirus immunity is measured in months to a year, not like measles immunity, which lasts a lifetime\nImmune response from an illness seems to vary by how serious or systemic an infection is.\n\u201cWhen someone gets sick ..\nwe don\u2019t know how long the antibody protection is going to last,\u201d Dr\nFauci said.\nThe November 2020 AMA Special Meeting of the AMA House of Delegates will be held Nov\n13\u201317, 2020, via a virtual platform.",

        "content": "(CNN)The United States is likely in for a hard winter as the Omicron variant of Covid-19 spreads rapidly, Dr\nAnthony Fauci says, straining a health care system already battered by the Delta variant.\n\"It's going to take over,\" Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said of the Omicron variant on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, urging Americans to get vaccinated and get their booster shots\n\"And be prudent in everything else you do: When you travel in your indoor settings that are congregated, wear a mask.\"\n\"We can't walk away from that, Jake, we can't,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper\n\"Because with Omicron, that we're dealing with, it is going to be a tough few weeks to months as we get deeper into the winter.\"\nAccording to the World Health Organization, Omicron cases are doubling every 1.5 to 3 days with documented spread\nAnd in the US, it's expected to become the \"dominant strain\" in the coming weeks, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.\nThe US is now facing a resurgent coronavirus as the pandemic marches into its third year: The country was averaging 126,967 new cases per day as of Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University -- up from an average of just over 70,000 new cases per day at the beginning of November.\n\"This Omicron variant is extraordinarily contagious\nIt's as contagious as measles, and that's about the most contagious virus that we've seen,\" CNN medical analyst Jonathan Reiner said Saturday, warning there was a \"tsunami\" coming for unvaccinated Americans.\nScientists say it's still too early to tell whether Omicron causes a milder form of Covid-19\nBut regardless, it will put pressure on the health care system, Reiner said.\n\"Why would you go into that kind of battle completely unarmed?\" said Reiner, a professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences\n\"Our vaccines will protect you, particularly if you are triple vaxed\nPeople who are unvaxed should start the process now\nGo ahead and go to your pharmacy and get vaccinated.\"\nIt's important to remain vigilant to help prevent hospitals from getting \"swamped,\" he added\nEven if Omicron ends up causing less severe infection than Delta, the sheer number of infections Omicron could generate could overwhelm US hospitals.\nMore than 69,000 people are hospitalized with Covid-19 across the US and more than 20% of all ICU beds are occupied by Covid-19 patients, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\"We need to protect our health care system,\" Reiner said, \"and that's why every American needs to mask up and vax up right now because our health care infrastructure is at stake right now.\"\nPresident Joe Biden will meet with his Covid-19 response team regarding the latest developments with the Omicron variant, according to the White House.\nThe meeting comes ahead of remarks Tuesday in which the President will discuss the variant, new steps the administration is taking and will issue another \"stark warning of what the winter will look like for Americans who choose to remain unvaccinated,\" the White House said.\nAccording to CDC data, about 61.4% of the total US population is fully vaccinated, and about 32.1% of fully vaccinated adults have received a booster, which health officials point to as a crucial line of defense against the Omicron variant\nAnd yet many who are eligible for a booster shot have not gotten one.\nThe protection offered from two-dose mRNA vaccines -- like those produced by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna -- is \"quite good particularly against severe disease,\" Fauci said Sunday.\n\"But when you get to Omicron, the protection significantly goes down,\" he said\n\"But the good news is when you boost someone, it goes right back up.\"\nUnvaccinated people face a 20 times greater risk of dying from Covid-19 and a 10 times greater risk of testing positive than fully-vaccinated people who have also received a booster, according to data recently published by the CDC.\nThe data suggests the gap in risk between unvaccinated people and those with a booster is even larger than it is between unvaccinated people and those who are fully vaccinated with their initial series.\nDr\nFrancis Collins, the outgoing director of the National Institutes of Health, told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday people should not wait to get boosted.\n\"A big message for today is, if you've had vaccines and a booster, you're very well-protected against Omicron causing you severe disease,\" he said\n\"So anybody listening to this who is in that 60% of Americans who are eligible for a booster but haven't yet gotten one, this is the week to do it\nDo not wait.\"\nOn Sunday, New York state broke its record for the highest single-day Covid-19 case count since the beginning of the pandemic for a third consecutive day\nGov\nKathy Hochul's office reported 22,478 positive cases Sunday, up from 21,908 positive Covid-19 cases Saturday.\nHochul reiterated her message to New Yorkers that despite surging numbers, they are in a far more favorable position than when the virus initially struck the Empire State last year.\n\"This is not March of 2020, we are not defenseless,\" she said in a statement Sunday\n\"We have the tools to protect ourselves and the vulnerable (loved) ones in our families: Get vaccinated, get the booster and wear a mask when indoors or in large gatherings\nDon't take a chance during the winter surge.\"\nCovid-19 hospitalizations across the state remained relatively low at 3,909, compared to a peak of 18,825 Covid-19 related hospitalizations on April 13, 2020, according to available data.\n\"This is not like the beginning of the pandemic,\" Hochul said in a statement Saturday\n\"We are prepared for the winter surge because we have the tools at our disposal.\"\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio echoed that message in a news conference Sunday, pointing, in part, to the availability of vaccines and boosters.\n\"We're not here to minimize the extent of the challenge -- it will be very challenging,\" the mayor said\n\"But it is something that we can meet\nIt is something we can overcome\nWe have the tools, but we need everyone to get in the game.\"\nIn New York City, Covid-19 cases more than doubled from the beginning of the week on December 13 to Saturday\nOn Sunday de Blasio reported a seven-day average of 5,731 new cases, a number he called \"a really, really shocking figure and one that will keep growing, undoubtedly.\"\nIn response, the city is also working to increase access to Covid-19 testing, the mayor said.\n\"You'll be seeing new testing sites, you'll be seeing more at-home testing kids being made available through community organizations,\" he said\n\"All of these efforts will help to reduce the lines we're seeing at testing sites and help to make testing more available.\"\nAt one testing site in Brooklyn, resident Rich Odior told CNN he waited two hours Sunday to get a test\nHe's vaccinated but has friends who've gotten Covid-19 or had scares, so he wanted to try to \"play it safe for the family.\"\nKymoi Phillip said he similarly felt getting a test was a safe choice because \"you never know who could have (a) case.\"\nBeing a student, Phillip said, he was concerned hearing of all the schools that have decided to close\n\"I'm afraid that my school might be getting shut down and we might go back into lockdown,\" adding he fears \"we may be in the same predicament that were were in last year.\"\nThe surge has already affected the city's entertainment industry, fording the cancellation of a number of Broadway shows in recent days -- just months after Broadway began welcoming audiences back after an extended pandemic hiatus.\nThis weekend's \"Saturday Night Live\" had no in-studio audience and aired mostly pre-taped segments because of the rise in Covid-19 cases.\nThe move followed the cancellation of the Radio City Rockettes' \"Christmas Spectacular\" shows for the rest of the year.\nHospitals are already impacted -- and bracing for more\nNew York isn't the only state grappling with a surge in cases or anxiety about what's to come.\nMaryland is bracing for what Gov\nLarry Hogan, a Republican, on Sunday said could be the \"worst surge we've seen in our hospitals throughout the entire crisis,\" telling \"Fox News Sunday\" hospitalizations are already up about 150% over the past two weeks.\nCalifornia health officials said Friday they were seeing hospitalization numbers begin to trend upward, stressing the need for vaccinations and booster vaccines.\nIn New Jersey, \"we're seeing long lines outside of our testing clinic, more demand than we've seen in many months for testing, because folks are getting sick,\" said Dr\nShereef Elnahal, president and CEO of University Hospital in Newark.\nHospitalizations have doubled over the past two weeks, he said, and although 46% of those hospitalized earlier this week had been vaccinated, they had not had a booster shot.\nDr\nRob Davidson, an emergency room physician in Michigan, said he's seeing a \"pretty critical Delta surge right now.\" And while he's seeing the test positivity rate slightly decrease, Covid-19 patients are staying in the hospital for extended periods of time.\nDr\nMarc Gorelick, who heads Children's Minnesota hospital, said the facility is already struggling to cope with the numbers.\n\"When you're on top of a surge where you're already at 90%, 95% capacity, those extra ..\npreventable Covid patients coming in are the thing that pushes the system to the brink,\" Gorelick said Friday.\nOregon officials forecast a grim early 2022: Dr\nPeter Graven, a data scientist for Oregon Health and Science University, said a surge in the state's hospitalizations could be expected by mid-January.\n\"Combined with its heightened transmissibility, we expect Omicron will generate a large increase in the number of Oregonians that will become severely ill and likely need a hospital.\"\nScientists are still working to gather information on how severe the Omicron variant is.\nData from two weeks of South African cases appeared to indicate Omicron was milder in severity\nBut UK epidemiologists said last week they found no evidence Omicron is causing milder disease there -- although the Imperial College London team also said there was not much data to go on yet.\nThe CDC looked at 43 cases of Omicron and most of those people had mild symptoms, it said last week\nMost were vaccinated, with about a third of the total group boosted.\n\"We've seen cases of Omicron among those who are both vaccinated and boosted, and we believe these cases are milder or asymptomatic because of vaccine protection\nWhat we do know is we have the tools to protect ourselves against Covid-19\nWe have vaccines\nWe have boosters,\" CDC Director Dr\nRochelle Walensky said Friday.\nCNN's Polo Sandoval, Sarah Jorgensen, Beth English, Christina Maxouris, Artemis Moshtaghian and Laura Studley contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)As the world approaches the second anniversary of the declaration of the Covid-19 pandemic by the World Health Organization, on March 11, more nations are rolling out -- or are discussing the possibility of -- fourth doses of coronavirus vaccine for their most vulnerable\nIn the United States, leading public health officials say they are \"very carefully\" monitoring if or when fourth doses might be needed.\nIsrael was the first nation to roll out fourth doses, announcing in December that adults 60 and older, medical workers and people with suppressed immune systems were eligible to receive the extra shot if at least four months have passed since their third dose.\nMore recently, the Public Health Agency of Sweden announced last week that second booster doses are recommended for everyone 80 and older in the country.\nIn the United States, health officials emphasized late last year that fourth doses were not yet needed and said it was too premature to be discussing a potential fourth dose of coronavirus vaccine for most people.\nNow, the US Food and Drug Administration \"is indeed continually looking at the emerging data on the pandemic and variants in the United States and overseas in order to evaluate the potential utility and composition of booster doses,\" FDA spokesperson Alison Hunt wrote in an email to CNN on Friday.\nShe confirmed that although Dr\nPeter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, has noted that there is still much uncertainty as to how the pandemic may further evolve, he also has said it is possible that a fourth dose might be recommended as we move into fall.\nA fall timeline coincides with the administration of flu shots, which could be convenient for people and makes sense scientifically because respiratory viruses -- like the coronavirus and influenza -- tend to peak in the winter months that follow.\n\"As more data become available about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including the use of a booster dose, we will continue to evaluate the rapidly changing science and keep the public informed,\" Hunt wrote\n\"Any determination that additional booster doses are needed will be based on data available to the agency.\"\nIf or when the FDA authorizes a fourth dose for the public, the next step would be for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to review the data before making a recommendation for use, as the agency has done for other coronavirus vaccine recommendations.\nThe United States has seen significant improvements recently in Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths\nAs of Friday, cases were down 44% from the prior week, hospitalizations dropped 26%, and deaths were 13% lower, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\"Vaccination and boosting will be critical in maintaining that downward trajectory, particularly when you're talking about the red curve of severe disease leading to hospitalization,\" Dr\nAnthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a White House Covid-19 Task Force briefing Wednesday.\nThe \"potential future requirement\" for an additional boost or a fourth shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines or a third dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine \"is being very carefully monitored in real time,\" Fauci said\n\"And recommendations, if needed, will be updated according to the data as it evolves.\"\nThe CDC has no recommendation of fourth doses of coronavirus vaccine for the general public, but the agency updated its guidelines in October to note that certain people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may receive a fourth dose of the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.\n\"For the immunocompetent people, a single booster shot continues to provide high levels of protection against severe disease caused by Omicron,\" Fauci said Wednesday\n\"This should not be confused with the fact that for many immunocompromised people, already a second booster shot -- namely a fourth dose of an mRNA -- is recommended because of what we know about their poor response to the initial regimen.\"\nPfizer announced in January that it has been studying the safety and efficacy of a fourth dose as part of its ongoing study of an Omicron-specific coronavirus vaccine among healthy adults ages 18 to 55.\nFor that study, participants have been separated into three cohorts\nOne includes 600 people who got three doses of the current Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine before enrolling in the study\nAs part of the research, they will receive either a fourth dose of the current vaccine or a dose of the Omicron-based vaccine.\n\"While current research and real-world data show that boosters continue to provide a high level of protection against severe disease and hospitalization with Omicron, we recognize the need to be prepared in the event this protection wanes over time and to potentially help address Omicron and new variants in the future,\" Kathrin Jansen, senior vice president and head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, said in the company's announcement of the study.\nA study published by the CDC last week showed that protection against Covid-19 hospitalization and emergency department or urgent care visits is much higher after a third vaccine dose than a second dose but that protection wanes with time.\nWith the Omicron variant dominant in the United States, vaccine effectiveness was 87% against Covid-19 emergency department or urgent care visits and 91% against hospitalizations in the two months after a third dose\nEffectiveness fell to 66% and 78%, respectively, by the fourth month, the data showed.\n\"Nonetheless, the level of 78 is still a good protective area,\" Fauci said Wednesday.\nDr\nChristopher Murray, director of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told CNN on Friday that he thinks having a fourth dose \"makes very little sense\" right now -- but possibly makes more sense this upcoming fall or winter.\n\"Because Omicron is going away,\" he said, \"third dose immunity wanes, and so fourth dose will probably wane as well\nSo we would want to time a fourth-dose push for when either there's a new variant or for next winter\nSo I think right now, unless you're immunocompromised or you're older, unless you have some personal risk, it doesn't make a lot of sense.\"\nThe research showing some waning immunity after a third dose has led to more discussion around if or when fourth doses could be needed.\n\"Just like with everything else, the health departments look at this data that's coming out and wait for guidance from the CDC and from the drug manufacturers\nThe drug manufacturers have been monitoring vaccine effectiveness,\" Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN on Friday.\nThe timing for fourth doses not only depends on waning immunity \"but also depends on whether we see any more variants emerge and what we discover in terms of additional vaccine effectiveness for any emerging new infections,\" Freeman said.\nIf fourth doses are needed, \"health departments would go into the mode of preparing to administer the fourth dose in the way they have done previous doses,\" Freeman said\nHowever, of greater concern among local public health officers is the slow -- and declining -- pace of people completing their third doses, she said.\nAbout 65% of the US population is fully vaccinated with at least their initial series, and about 28% of the population has received a booster dose, according to the CDC, as of Friday\nBut the pace of booster doses being administered has dropped to one of the slowest rates yet.\n\"As time goes on, if there is the necessity of a fourth dose, we're already behind with people getting the third dose,\" Freeman said\n\"So all of a sudden, we could have a fairly large segment of the population that is not up to date on vaccines because they're behind by two doses, potentially, and more people could get sick.\"\nCNN's Katherine Dillinger contributed to this report.",

that people who receive two different COVID-19 vaccines generate potent immune responses, with side effects no worse than those caused by standard regimens.\nBut now, for the first time, researchers have shown that such \u2018mix and match\u2019 regimens are highly effective at preventing COVID-19 \u2014 roughly matching or even exceeding the performance of mRNA vaccines.\nThe high antibody

as one would expect,\u201d says immunologist Martina Sester at Saarland University in Homburg, Germany\n\u201cThis is really good news and this will certainly have influence on clinical practice.\u201d\n\u201cThese emerging effectiveness data support the use of these approved COVID-19 vaccines in either the standard or mixed schedules,\u201d adds Matthew Snape, a vaccinologist at the University of Oxford, UK.\nThe studies sprang out of a natural experiment that began in March, when a number of countries partially or completely halted the use of the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca in Cambridge, UK, because of extremely rare but serious side effects\nThis meant that some people who\u2019d already received one dose of this vaccine then had a different vaccine as their second jab\nSester\u2019s team and several others demonstrated that these mix-and-match combinations were safe and led to a strong immune response1,2,3.\nNow, three teams have provided the first measurements of the effectiveness of mix-and-match regimens\nThe studies looked at various populations at various times \u2014 including during the rise of the hyper-infectious Delta variant \u2014 but they all agree that mix-and-match, or heterologous, vaccination is highly protective.\nOne took took place in Sweden, where the health authorities severely curtailed the use of the Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca vaccine, which relies on a weakened chimpanzee cold virus\nAs a result, more than 100,000 people in Sweden received a dose of AstraZeneca, followed by an mRNA-based jab \u2014 either the vaccine from Moderna in Cambridge, Massachusetts, or the one developed by pharmaceutical company Pfizer, based in New York City, and biotechnology firm BioNTech in Mainz, Germany.\nBeneficial mismatch\nEpidemiologist Peter Nordstr\u00f6m at Ume\u00e5 University in Sweden and his co-authors analysed data in the country\u2019s national health registers, which contain vaccination and COVID-19 testing and treatment information for all residents\nThey found that compared with unvaccinated people, those on a mixed vaccination schedule were 68% less likely to develop a symptomatic infection, whereas the 430,000 people who received two doses of AstraZeneca were 50% less likely to do so4\nThese and other figures make it clear that the heterologous regimens are more effective than two doses of AstraZeneca, Nordstr\u00f6m says.\nThe conclusion echoes that of a similar analysis5 in Denmark, which has national health and vaccination registries similar to Sweden\u2019s\nDenmark halted all use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in April\nEpidemiologist Mie Agermose Gram, at the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen, and co-authors found that one dose of AstraZeneca followed by one dose of Pfizer\u2013BioNTech was 88% effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection \u2014 an effectiveness similar to that of two doses of Pfizer\nTheir study has not yet been peer reviewed.\nNo need for brand loyalty\nOne study found that mix-and-match regimens could be more effective than two doses of an mRNA vaccine\nImmunologist Thierry Walzer, at Inserm and the University of Lyon in France, and his co-authors analysed data from 2,512 health-care workers who received a combination of AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines, and more than 10,000 who received two doses of the latter\nThe team showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in the mix-and-match group were half that of the group that received two doses of Pfizer6.\nMix-and-match COVID-19 vaccines might have passed the effectiveness test, but questions remain, such as how well the mix-and-match vaccines will hold up over time, and whether and when they need boosting with extra doses, says Nordstr\u00f6m\nIn unpublished data, his team has found that the durability of the protection conferred by mixed vaccinations is comparable with that of mRNA vaccines\nBut the data also hint that higher-risk individuals would benefit from a third dose.\nKnowing that mix-and-match vaccines are highly effective will have global implications, says Sester\nThere is some evidence that immunosuppressed individuals mount a strong immune response to mixed regimens7, so it\u2019s possible that mixing doses could protect organ-transplant recipients and others with weakened immune systems better than do the standard regimens\nThe data could also support mixed immunization programmes in lower-income countries, where there might be shortages of certain vaccines\n\u201cThese data are really important towards policies,\u201d she says.\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-02853-4",

        "content": "Some people with a weakened immune system can get a fourth dose of the coronavirus vaccine as early as this coming week, according to recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that were updated last week.\nThe C.D.C\nendorsed a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised people on Aug\n13, but said this would be considered a part of the primary immunization, not a booster shot.\nIn October, the agency said those immunocompromised people could receive a booster shot \u2014 a fourth dose of vaccine, six months after their third dose\nThese guidelines were consistent with its recommendation for other adults.\nLast week, hoping to stem the surge of infections with the highly contagious Omicron variant, the C.D.C\nshortened that interval to five months for a booster shot for Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna recipients.\nFor immunocompromised people who received a single shot of the coronavirus vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson, the C.D.C\ndoes not recommend additional primary doses, but advises that they get a booster shot of the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines two months after the first dose.\nSome people are born with absent or faulty immune systems, and in others, treatments for some diseases like cancer diminish the potency of immune defenses\nThe C.D.C\nestimates there are about seven million immunocompromised individuals in the country.\nMany of them produce few to no antibodies in response to a vaccine or an infection, leaving them susceptible to the virus\nWhen they do become infected, they may suffer prolonged illness, with death rates as high as 55 percent.\nIt is unclear what proportion of those people are protected by additional doses\nStill, with the Omicron variant surging in the country, some immunocompromised people sought out fourth or even fifth shots of the vaccines even before the C.D.C\nchanged its guidelines\nWhile receiving multiple doses of vaccines in a short period is unlikely to be harmful, it may produce diminishing returns, according to some experts.\nThe C.D.C\nhas said that any American 12 and older can receive a Pfizer-BioNTech booster \u2014 those 18 and older can alternatively receive a Moderna booster \u2014 five months after completing their initial shots with those vaccines\nIsrael has already begun offering fourth doses to high-risk groups including older adults\nBut the Biden administration has not yet said whether it plans to follow suit.\nWhen asked on Friday about the possibility of a fourth shot for the general population, Dr\nRochelle Walensky, director of the C.D.C., said that focus remained on Americans eligible for their third shots.\nShe added that U.S\nofficials remained in close touch with Israel experts about their data\n\u201cWe will be following our own data carefully as well, to see how these boosters are working in terms of waning effectiveness, not just for infection but, importantly, for severe disease,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Although new federal data suggests that the effectiveness of booster shots wanes after about four months, the Biden administration is not planning to recommend fourth doses of the coronavirus vaccine anytime soon.\n\u201cWe simply don\u2019t have enough data to know that it\u2019s a good thing to do,\u201d Dr\nPeter Marks, who heads the division of the Food and Drug Administration that regulates vaccines, said in an interview this week.\nIn a separate interview, Dr\nAnthony S\nFauci, the chief medical adviser to the White House, said the vaccines are still a firm bulwark against severe illness, despite data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that booster shots lose some of their potency after four to five months.\nThe C.D.C.\u2019s research, released last Friday, analyzed hospitalizations and visits to emergency rooms and urgent care clinics in 10 states by people who had had booster shots of either Moderna\u2019s or Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s vaccine\nThe study showed the level of protection against hospitalization fell from 91 percent in the two months after a third shot to 78 percent after four to five months\nEffectiveness against visits to emergency rooms or urgent care clinics declined from 87 percent to 66 percent.\nThe data came with major caveats: Researchers did not examine variations by age group, underlying medical conditions or the presence of immune deficiencies\nStill, they said, the findings underscored the possible importance of a fourth shot.\n\u201c\u2018Should I get a fourth shot?\u2019 That\u2019s what a lot of people are asking me,\u201d Dr\nFauci said\n\u201cThe answer is if you look at where we are now, it looks like it\u2019s good protection\nSeventy-eight percent is good.\u201d\nThe administration\u2019s vaccine strategy has been under constant review since President Biden took office\nWhat comes next, Dr\nFauci said, will depend on whether protection from boosters holds steady or continues to drop after four to five months \u2014 and if it keeps dropping, how steeply.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only the number, it\u2019s the inflection of the curve,\u201d he said.\nThat means more uncertainty for Americans exhausted by frequent changes in vaccine recommendations \u2014 pivots largely forced by the onset of new variants\nDr\nSterling Ransone, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said his patients keep asking about whether a fourth shot will be necessary and if so, when.\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, right?\u201d said Dr\nRansone, who practices in the small town of Deltaville, Va\n\u201cWe humans want some certainty and control of the situation\nAnd this is a case where we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the future\nWe don\u2019t know the exact recommendation.\u201d\nIn Bangor, Maine, Dr\nJames W\nJarvis, who leads Covid response for Northern Light Health, a local health care system, said that he stresses to his patients how well the vaccines are working, even if boosters are needed\nAlthough they don\u2019t offer complete protection, he said, \u201cthe most recent data really suggests that these vaccines are still doing a good job.\u201d\nData from Britain is similar to that from the C.D.C., indicating that boosters are about 75 percent to 85 percent effective against hospitalization four to six months after they are given\nIsrael has also noted waning of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine\u2019s effectiveness in the months after a booster shot, according to the C.D.C.\nIsrael began offering a fourth shot in late December, at first only to health care workers though eligibility has broadened\nThe C.D.C\nhas recommended that those with immune deficiencies get three shots as part of their initial series, followed by a fourth shot as a booster.\nBiden administration officials say two-thirds of eligible adults have gotten a booster shot since the additional injections were authorized in November\nUptake has been slower among children over 12, who only became eligible in early January.\nCard 1 of 3\nThe virus in the U.S\nPresident Biden said that he would extend the national emergency first declared in March 2020 in response to the pandemic, which was set to expire on March 1\nThe decision comes as an Omicron wave recedes, though it now accounts for more deaths than Delta\u2019s did.\nIn New York\nThe New York health commissioner announced that the state would not enforce a booster-shot requirement for health care workers set to take effect on Feb\n21\nToo many workers were refusing to comply, leading to worries that the health care system would be disrupted with a mandate in place.\nAround the world\nHong Kong said it would postpone the election of its next leader so that it could focus on containing a surge driven by Omicron\nSouth Korea, where the variant shows no sign of peaking, reported 100,000 new daily coronavirus cases for the first time on Feb\n18, topping that threshold again the following day.\nDr\nMarks said it may turn out that the best time for an additional shot is this fall, when the spread of the coronavirus is expected to pick up again\n\u201cBarring any surprises from new variants, maybe the best thing is to think about our booster strategy in conjunction with the influenza vaccine next fall, and get as many people as possible boosted then,\u201d he said.\nDr\nRansone said some of his patients would prefer that, so they can get their immunizations in a single visit.\nAt a session hosted last month by the F.D.A\nand the University of California, San Francisco, Dr\nMarks said he hoped that a third shot would be enough of a shield against disease that only a yearly Covid booster would be needed\nBut both he and Dr\nFauci said it is impossible to make any prediction without more data.\nEarlier this month, Dr\nFauci suggested that any recommendation would likely be aimed at those most at risk, possibly based on age as well as underlying conditions.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be hearing, if you do, any kind of recommendations that would be across the board for everyone,\u201d he said at a White House briefing\n\u201cIt very likely will take into account what subset of people have a diminished, or not, protection against the important parameters such as hospitalization.\u201d",

        "content": "LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Protection against COVID-19 offered by two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines begins to fade within six months, underscoring the need for booster shots, according to researchers in Britain.\nAfter five to six months, the effectiveness of the Pfizer jab at preventing COVID-19 infection in the month after the second dose fell from 88% to 74%, an analysis of data collected in Britain's ZOE COVID study showed.\nFor the AstraZeneca vaccine, effectiveness fell from 77% to 67% after four to five months.\nThe study was based on data from more than a million app users, comparing self-reported infections in vaccinated participants with cases in an unvaccinated control group.\nMore data is needed in younger people because participants who had their shots up to six months ago tended to be elderly as that age group was prioritised when the shots were first approved, the study authors said.\nZOE Ltd was founded three years ago to offer customised nutritional advice based on test kits\nThe company's ZOE COVID Symptom Study app is a not-for-profit initiative in collaboration with King\u2019s College London and funded by the Department of Health and Social Care.\nUnder a worst-case future scenario, protection could fall below 50% for older people and healthcare workers by the winter, Tim Spector, ZOE Ltd co-founder and principal investigator for the study, said.\n\"It's bringing into focus this need for some action\nWe can't just sit by and see the protectiveness slowly waning whilst cases are still high and the chance of infection still high as well,\" Spector told BBC television.\nBritain and other European nations are planning for a COVID-19 vaccine booster campaign later this year after top vaccine advisers said it might be necessary to give third shots to the elderly and most vulnerable from September.\nThe U.S\ngovernment is preparing to provide third booster doses starting in mid-September to Americans who had their initial course more than eight months ago.\n\"This is a reminder that we cannot rely on vaccines alone to prevent the spread of COVID,\" said Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the study.\nHe cautioned that the results may have been distorted by the surge in overall cases in Britain in July.\nA separate British public health study found last week that protection from either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the AstraZeneca vaccine against the now prevalent Delta variant of the coronavirus weakens within three months.\nThe Oxford University study found at the time that 90 days after a second shot of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine, their efficacy in preventing infections had slipped to 75% and 61% respectively\nThat was down from 85% and 68%, respectively, seen two weeks after a second dose.",

        "content": "Dec 7 (Reuters) - The Omicron variant can partially evade protection from two doses of Pfizer (PFE.N) and partner BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, the research head of a laboratory at the Africa Health Research Institute in South Africa said on Tuesday.\nBut the study showed that blood from people who had received two doses of the vaccine and had a prior infection was mostly able to neutralize the variant, suggesting that booster doses of the vaccine could help to fend off infection.\nThe Omicron variant, first detected in southern Africa last month, has triggered alarms globally of another surge in infections, with more than two dozen countries from Japan to the United States reporting cases.\nThe World Health Organization classified it on Nov\n26 as a \"variant of concern,\" but said there was no evidence to support the need for new vaccines specifically designed to tackle the Omicron variant with its many mutations\nread more\nAlex Sigal, a professor at the research institute, said on Twitter there was \"a very large drop\" in neutralization of the Omicron variant relative to an earlier strain of COVID-19.\nA separate lab test by virologist Sandra Ciesek of the University Hospital Frankfurt painted a somewhat bleaker picture.\nExposing the blood of vaccinated individuals to different virus variants, she found that the ability to mount an antibody response to Omicron in people who had three shots of BioNTech/Pfizer was up to 37 times lower than the response to Delta.\nAn antibody response to Omicron half a year after a two-shot regimen of Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna or a mixed course of AstraZeneca/BioNTech was not even measurable, Ciesek added.\nShe posted only selected findings on Twitter, not including the number of samples, and the university said the paper had not yet been published.\n\"The set of data underscores that it makes sense to develop a vaccine that is adapted to Omicron,\" Chiesek tweeted, adding that no conclusion could be drawn about protection against severe disease.\nWHO's chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, said a large drop in the antibody response of vaccinated people to Omicron had been expected.\n\"This does not mean the vaccine will not work - T-cell immunity (is) likely to persist,\" she said on Twitter, referring to a cellular immune response that is believed to prevent severe disease as a second line of immune defence.\nResearchers including Carsten Watzl of the German Society of Immunology and Penny Ward, visiting professor at King\u2019s College London, said the findings underscored the need to get booster shots because a three-shot course would likely continue to protect against severe disease.\nSigal's lab tested blood from 12 people who had been vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, according to a manuscript posted on the website for his lab\nThe preliminary data in the manuscript has not yet been peer reviewed.\nBlood from five out of six people who had been vaccinated as well as previously infected with COVID-19 still neutralized the Omicron variant, the manuscript said.\n\"These results are better than I expected\nThe more antibodies you got, the more chance you'll be protected from Omicron,\" Sigal said on Twitter.\nHe said the lab had not tested the variant against blood from people who had received a booster dose, because they are not available in South Africa yet.\nAccording to the manuscript, the lab observed a 41-fold decline in levels of neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron variant.\nSigal said on Twitter that figure is likely to be adjusted after his lab does more experiments.\nWhile neutralizing antibodies are an indicator of the body's immune response, scientists believe other kinds of cells such as B-cells and T-cells are also stimulated by the vaccines and help protect against the effects of the coronavirus.\nThe preliminary data does not indicate that the vaccine is less able to prevent severe illness or death\nWhile lab tests are under way, BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said last week \"we think it's likely that people will have substantial protection against severe disease caused by Omicron\"\nread more\nThere is not significant data yet on how vaccines from Moderna (MRNA.O), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and other drugmakers hold up against the new variant\nAll the manufacturers, including Pfizer and BioNTech, are expected to release their own data within weeks.\nBioNTech's Sahin told NBC News on Tuesday that the drugmaker has data coming on Wednesday or Thursday.\nReporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru and Michael Erman in New Jersey, Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta, Lisa Shumaker, Peter Cooney, Kim Coghill and Nick Macfie",

        "content": "Study assesses vaccine efficacy since new variant\nTwo doses of Pfizer offer 70% protection against hospitalisation\nFindings are some of earliest outside lab studies\nData preliminary, scientists say uncertainty remains\nJOHANNESBURG, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine has been less effective in South Africa at keeping people infected with the virus out of hospital since the Omicron variant emerged last month, a real-world study published on Tuesday showed.\nBetween Nov\n15 and Dec\n7, people who had received two doses of the shot had a 70% chance of avoiding hospitalisation, down from 93% during the previous wave of Delta infections, the study showed.\nWhen it came to avoiding infection altogether, the study by South Africa's largest private health insurance administrator, Discovery Health, showed that protection against catching COVID-19 had slumped to 33% from 80% previously.\nThe findings from the real-world analysis are some of the first about the protection vaccines offer against Omicron outside of laboratory studies, which have so far shown a reduced ability to neutralise the virus\nread more\nThe study results were based on an analysis by Discovery's (DSYJ.J) clinical research and actuarial teams in collaboration with the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC).\nSouth Africa alerted the world to Omicron in November, triggering alarm that it could cause another surge in global infections and leading to travel curbs on southern Africa\nSouth Africa's daily infections have since risen to more than 20,000, with 35% of tests coming back positive in figures reported on Tuesday, and a further 600 hospital admissions and 24 deaths.\nThe South African study was based on more than 211,000 COVID-19 test results of which 78,000 were attributed to Omicron, the variant labelled \"of concern\" by the World Health Organization and reported in more than 60 countries.\nThe 78,000 cases were attributed to Omicron based on the relative prevalence of the variant within the country over the study period, but because they have not been confirmed as being the new variant the study cannot offer conclusive findings.\nSouth African scientists sent 630 positive COVID-19 tests for genome sequencing in November to see if they were Omicron and another 61 so far in December\nLast month, 78% were confirmed as Omicron and all 61 this month were the new variant.\n'CONFOUNDING FACTOR'\nDiscovery cautioned that the study's findings should be considered preliminary\nMichael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, also said there was a large degree of uncertainty for now about Omicron.\n\"It is important to avoid inferring too much right now from any national scenario\nFor example, the narrative around South Africa is that Omicron may be much milder, whereas reports out of Denmark broadly suggests the opposite,\" he said.\nSouth Africa is using the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) vaccines in its immunisation campaign, with more than 20 million Pfizer doses administered so far.\nJ&J and the SAMRC are conducting a large real-world study of J&J's vaccine and recent analysis has shown no deaths from Omicron, SAMRC President Glenda Gray said.\n\"So that's the good news, it shows again that the vaccine is effective against severe disease and death,\" she said.\nWith at least 70% of the South African population estimated to have been exposed to COVID-19 over the past 18 months, high estimated levels of existing antibodies might skew the data.\n\"This could be a confounding factor for these hospital admission and severity indicators during this Omicron wave,\" Ryan Noach, chief executive of Discovery Health, said in a briefing on the study.\nThe analysis showed protection against hospital admission was maintained across all ages, from 18 to 79 years, with slightly lower levels of protection for the elderly.\nProtection against admission was also consistent across a range of chronic illnesses including diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and other cardiovascular diseases.\nREINFECTION RISK\nThe study concluded there was a higher risk of reinfection during the fourth wave than during previous waves and the risk of hospitalisation among adults diagnosed with COVID-19 was still 29% lower than during the country's first wave last year.\nChildren appeared to have a 20% higher risk of hospital admission with complications during the fourth wave than during the first, despite a very low absolute incidence, it said.\n\"This is early data and requires careful follow up,\" said Shirley Collie, chief health analytics actuary at Discovery Health.\nHowever, this trend aligns with a warning in recent days from South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) that during the country's third wave from June to September they had seen an increase in paediatric admissions and now, in the fourth wave, they are seeing a similar increase in admissions for children under five, she said.\nSouth African scientists have said they cannot confirm a link between Omicron and the high admissions of infants, which could be due to other factors.\nMany unknowns still surround Omicron.\nThe WHO has said there were early signs that vaccinated and previously infected people would not build enough antibodies to ward off an Omicron infection, resulting in high transmission rates, but was unclear whether Omicron was inherently more contagious than the globally dominant Delta variant.\nPfizer and BioNTech said last week that two shots of their vaccine may still protect against severe disease, because its mutations were unlikely to evade the T-cells' response\nread more",

        "content": "Via Teleconference\n12:40 P.M\nEDT\nMR\nZIENTS: Good morning, and thank you for joining us\nDr\nWalensky, Dr\nFauci, Dr\nNunez-Smith and I will keep our comments brief this morning so we can get to your questions.\nI\u2019ll start with an update on our fight against the Delta variant\nThe Delta variant continues to drive a rise in cases, with cases concentrated in communities with lower vaccination rates.\nIn the past week, Florida has had more COVID cases than all 30 states with the lowest case rates combined\nAnd Florida and Texas alone have accounted for nearly 40 percent of new hospitalizations across the country.\nWe all know that vaccinations are the very best line of defense against COVID and how we end this pandemic\nThat is why we\u2019ve been tireless in our efforts to get more and more Americans vaccinated.\nFor the first time since mid-June, we\u2019re averaging about a half million people getting newly vaccinated each and every day\nAnd overall in the last week, 3.3 million Americans rolled up their sleeve to get their first shot.\nIn the past month, we have doubled the average number of 12- to 17-year-olds getting newly vaccinated each day \u2014 critical progress as millions of adolescents start heading back to school.\nImportantly, we\u2019re seeing the most significant vaccinations progress in states with the highest case rates.\nIn fact, in the past month, we have nearly tripled the average number of shots each day in Arkansas and quadrupled in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi.\nSo, we\u2019re getting more shots in arms in the places that need them the most\nThat\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take to end this pandemic: more vaccinations, more Americans doing their part and rolling up their sleeve.\nOver the past few weeks, we\u2019ve seen strong actions from across the public and private sectors to help end the pandemic.\nThe President recently announced vaccination requirements for all 4 million federal workers, and we are working to apply similar standards to all federal contractors.\nOn Monday, the Department of Defense announced its plans to add COVID-19 vaccines to the list of vaccines required for more than 1.7 million active duty, reserve, and National Guard personnel.\nAnd just this morning, the Department of Veteran Affairs and the Department of Health and Human Services announced new requirements: All 350,000 VA healthcare personnel and all 25,000 HHS healthcare personnel must now be fully vaccinated.\nState and local governments; healthcare systems; businesses, small and large; universities; and other institutions are also stepping up.\nSince last week, Washington State; Washington, D.C.; and Seattle have all adopted vaccination requirements, and more than 50 health systems across the country have announced that all staff need to be vaccinated, bringing the total to more than 200 health systems.\nJust in the past 24 hours, Amtrak, McDonald\u2019s, NBCUniversal, Discovery, and Capital One all announced new rules that workers must be vaccinated to return to the office.\nCalifornia announced all schoolteachers and staff in the state, serving more than 6 million students, will be required to be vaccinated or tested weekly.\nAnd the NEA and the AFT, two of the largest unions in the country \u2014 representing 5 million educators, childcare workers, and school staff \u2014 both came out in favor of school districts pursuing COVID-19 vaccination policies, including requirements for teachers and staff.\nAnd across the country, nearly 700 colleges and universities have announced vaccination requirements, which will cover roughly 5 million students getting ready to head back to school.\nSo, clearly, vaccination requirements are gaining momentum across the country and are already covering tens of millions of workers, educators, college and university students, and healthcare providers.\nThey will help keep people and communities safe and help stop the spread of the virus.\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: Through vaccination requirements, employers have the power to help end the pandemic.\nAs we drive progress on vaccinations, we are accelerating our efforts to help states respond to outbreaks caused by Delta.\nOur COVID-19 Surge Response Teams have deployed more than 500 federal personnel, including hundreds of healthcare personnel in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arizona to provide emergency medical care.\nCDC is on the ground in Tennessee, Illinois, and Missouri to help local outbreak investigations and vaccination efforts.\nWe\u2019ve sent ambulances and paramedics to Missouri and Louisiana\nAnd in Florida, we\u2019ve stood up dozens of free testing sites and sent 200 ventilators to hospitals in the state.\nAnd importantly, as Dr\nNunez-Smith will discuss, we sent five times as many lifesaving therapeutics to states in July compared to June.\nI\u2019ll close with this: We are doing everything we can to get people vaccinated and support state and local leaders on the ground\nBut as we have said from the start, ending this pandemic requires every American doing their part.\nSo, please, if you\u2019re unvaccinated, get your shot\nIt\u2019s free, it\u2019s convenient, it works, and it\u2019s never been more important.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Dr\nWalensky.\nDR\nWALENSKY: Thank you, Jeff\nGood afternoon.\nLet\u2019s begin with an overview of the data\nYesterday, CDC reported 132,384 new cases of COVID-19\nOur seven-day average is about 113,000 cases per day, and this represents an increase of nearly 24 percent from the prior seven-day average.\nThe seven-day average of hospital admissions is at about 9,700 per day, an increase of about 31 percent from the prior seven-day period\nAnd the seven-day average of daily deaths has also increased to 452 per day, an increase of 22 percent from the prior seven-day period.\nWe continue to see cases, hospitalizations, and deaths increase across the country\nAnd now, over 90 percent of counties in the United States are experiencing substantial or high transmission.\nAs we have been saying: By far, those at highest risk remain people who have not yet been vaccinated\nThis week, we are taking two important steps in encouraging and improving vaccine protection for Americans.\nFirst, for pregnant people who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, we are strengthening our guidance and recommending that all pregnant people or people thinking about becoming pregnant get vaccinated.\nWe now have new data that reaffirm the safety of our vaccines for people who are pregnant, including those early in pregnancy and around the time of conception\nThese data build on previous evidence from three safety monitoring systems that did not find any safety concerns for pregnant people who are vaccinated late in pregnancy or for their babies.\nNow these new data found no increase in the risk for miscarriage among people who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine before 20 weeks of pregnancy.\nClinicians have seen the number of pregnant people infected with COVID-19 rise in the past several weeks\nThe increased circulation of the highly contagious Delta variant, the general low vaccine uptake among pregnant people, and the increased risk of severe illness and pregnancy complications related to COVID-19 infection among pregnant people make vaccination for this population more urgent than ever.\nSecond, I want to take a moment to discuss what we are doing to help increase protection against COVID-19 for certain individuals who are moderately and severely immunocompromised.\nAs we\u2019ve been saying for weeks, emerging data show that certain people who are immunocompromised, such as people who have had organ transplant and some cancer patients, may not have had an adequate immune response to just two doses of the COVID vaccine.\nTo be clear, this is a very small population\nWe estimate it to be less than 3 percent of adults.\nWe\u2019ve been working to identify how best to provide increased protection to these vulnerable people who are disproportionately impacted by severe outcomes due to COVID-19\nFDA is working with Pfizer and Moderna to allow boosters for these vulnerable people.\nAn additional dose could help increase protections for these individuals, which is especially important as the Delta variant spreads.\nFollowing the FDA\u2019s decision, CDC will hold a meeting of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices tomorrow to discuss this issue and offer their expert insights and recommendations\nWe look forward to that discussion and to helping support this vulnerable population.\nAt this time, only certain immune compromised individuals may need an additional dose\nEmerging data, including from a significant study published in the New England Journal of Medicine yesterday, show that there\u2019s an enhanced antibody response after an additional dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in some immunocompromised people.\nThis action is about ensuring our most vulnerable, who may need an additional dose to enhance their biological responses to the vaccines, are better protected against COVID-19.\nThe science and resulting data in this pandemic are moving extremely rapidly\nThe U.S\ngovernment, in turn, is moving swiftly to analyze the science and make the recommendations most appropriate to protect Americans\nWe know our vaccines are safe and effective\nAnd if you have not gotten a vaccine yet, please do so today.\nThank you\nI\u2019ll turn things over to Dr\nFauci.\nDR\nFAUCI: Thank you very much, Dr\nWalensky.\nSo, it\u2019s becoming very clear now \u2014 if you go to the first slide \u2014 that we are dealing with a global outbreak of the Delta variant\nI keep updating this slide; it now shows that at least 117 countries now have the Delta variant since it was first detected in June of 2020.\nSo, let\u2019s just review some of the aspects of Delta to help put it into the context of what we\u2019re talking about\nWe know the transmissibility \u2014 that it\u2019s greater than the Alpha variant, at least two times as great\nThis makes a major difference in transmissibility\nThe viral load is up to 1,000 times greater in the nasalpharynx of people with Delta than Alpha, which is a mechanistic reason why you have such a tremendous increase in transmissibility.\nNext slide.\nIn previous reviews before this group, I have shown this slide, in checking the boxes as to the proof of protection against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant\nThere was one glaring, missing check in previous iterations of this, and that was in the J&J clinical effectiveness.\nNext slide.\nI had showed you before this slide looking at data of immune responses in vitro\nAnd this was the J&J vaccine study, which showed that it elicited durable antibody and cellular responses against Delta with minimal decreases for at least eight months after immunization.\nNext slide.\nWe now have a slide that recently \u2014 a study that recently came out from South Africa and other southern African countries \u2014 it\u2019s called the Sisonke study \u2014 involving about 478,000 healthcare workers\nAnd this is real-world effectiveness against Delta, with a 91 to 96 percent protection against Delta, and then 71 percent protection against hospitalization.\nAnd remember, I showed you before that the durability of the immune response is out to eight months\nAnd this is the first real-world data to show the effectiveness of J&J from this challenging epidemiological setting of Delta, particularly in the context of people who might have HIV.\nNext slide.\nFinally, if you look at breakthrough infections \u2014 which are inevitable with any vaccine, because no vaccine is 100 percent effective \u2014 as you can see, as we\u2019ve seen in other studies, the breakthrough infections, namely infections that occur in the setting of full vaccination, were mild in 96 percent, moderate in 3 percent, severe in less than 0.05 percent, with death in less than 0.05 percent.\nSo, I\u2019ll stop there and hand it over to Marcella Nunez-Smith.\nDR\nNUNEZ-SMITH: Thank you so much, Dr\nFauci\nAnd good afternoon to everyone\nToday, I\u2019ll just take a couple moments\nI want to update you on vaccination equity, as well as on the importance of COVID-19 therapies.\nSo, first, when it comes to vaccinations and equity, important to note that the majority of people who are getting vaccinated through the direct federal programs are self-identifying as people of color \u2014 so that\u2019s through community health centers, through dialysis centers, and at our Federal Retail Pharmacy partners.\nIn a sense, President Biden made all adults in the U.S\neligible for vaccine on April 19th, and the majority of individuals receiving vaccines have identified as people of color.\nSo that is notable progress, but it does not change the fact, as we\u2019ve been discussing, that there is, of course, still more work to do.\nAnd the work in this phase of the vaccination campaign remains hyperlocal\nAnd that\u2019s why the Biden-Harris administration will continue to work just hand in hand with states and territories, Tribes, cities \u2014 always centering our partnerships with faith-based and community-based organizations, supporting that trusted outreach work that needs to be done.\nI just want to provide a couple examples of the administration\u2019s resource commitment to engage partnership\nYou know, in June and July, the federal administration awarded over $240 million to support community-based workers, community-based efforts \u2014 really expanding local, tailored opportunity to build both vaccine confidence and vaccine access.\nThis past week, the CDC officially launched the Partnering for Vaccine Equity program\nThat\u2019s an investment of $120 million in grants that have been awarded.\nAnd later this week, $20 million will be distributed specifically to Native Hawaiian communities.\nIn meeting people where they are, partnership is so powerful\nAnd many of the incredible partners doing this work are health centers\nThis is National Health Center Week\nAnd on behalf of the administration, I want to say thank you to health centers across the country: your commitment, your dedication reaching underserved groups \u2014 health centers on that frontline in vaccine administration, in testing, and in the administration of safe, effective therapies.\nAs Jeff mentioned earlier, these therapies do include monoclonal antibodies\nAnd I want to talk a minute about those, but to people across the country, let me just reiterate: The best strategy to remain protected from the worst of COVID-19 is to get fully vaccinated.\nBut if you get COVID-19 and you\u2019re at high risk, I want to assure you about these therapies\nThe monoclonal antibodies work\nThey are safe\nThey\u2019re free\nThey keep people out of the hospital and help keep them alive.\nAnd our surge teams have been working closely with states, increasing access, provider uptake, and patient confidence\nWe\u2019ve conducted virtual trainings for physicians and health system officials\nAnd this has been \u2014 you know, in Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, with more to come in Alabama and elsewhere.\nAnd in fact, in Arizona, we have a federal clinical team on the ground now, helping to set up and run two sites to provide these treatments\nAnd those efforts are paying off.\nNow, of the COVID-positive patients the Arizona team has treated so far, not one has required hospitalization after that treatment.\nBut we can also report that we\u2019ve surged shipments to the states with the highest rates of community transmission\nFor example, Florida shipments increased over eightfold over the past month.\nAnd in July, more than 108,000 treatments were shipped all over the country by the federal government\nAnd as Jeff mentioned, this represents more than a fivefold increase nationally from June.\nOver the course of the entire pandemic, more than 600,000 patients across the country have received monoclonal antibody treatments; that\u2019s hospitalizations averted and lives saved.\nSo, the Biden-Harris administration continues to stand ready to assist states and territories and jurisdictions across the country to get more people connected to testing, to treatment, and, absolutely, to vaccination.\nSo, thank you so much\nAnd with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you, Jeff.\nMR\nZIENTS: Okay, well, thank you, doctors\nLet\u2019s open it up for questions.\nFirst question.\nMODERATOR: Sabrina Siddiqui at The Wall Street Journal.\nQ Yes\nHi, thank you so much as always for doing the briefing\nWe\u2019re seeing a rising number of children being infected with COVID-19\nSo, I have a two-fold question: Is there data to suggest that the Delta variant is more virulent in children? And given that increase, are you still confident that schools can fully reopen for in-person instruction, or are you considering further changes to the guidelines?\nMR\nZIENTS: Let\u2019s start with Dr\nFauci on the first part of the question, and then Dr\nWalensky on school openings.\nDr\nFauci.\nDR\nFAUCI: Thank you, Jeff\nWell, in answer to the first part of your question: There\u2019s no doubt that there are more children getting infected\nAs I mentioned in one of my slides, the Delta variant is much more highly transmissible than was Alpha\nSo, given that, you will see more children likely get infected.\nAnd since you have a certain percentage of children, even though the percentage is small, a certain percentage of children will require hospitalization\nSo, quantitatively, you will see more children in the hospital.\nRegarding the severity of illness, there was a couple of studies, mostly international, which suggested that Delta was more severe in adults, namely causing more (inaudible) relative percentage of hospitalization and more severe disease.\nWith regard to children, this could possibly be the case, but we are not seeing this in a definitive way\nThe only thing we know for sure is that more infections mean more children will be in the hospital.\nWith regard to the school part \u2014 about that, I think we\u2019ll go back to Dr\nWalensky.\nDR\nWALENSKY: Thank you, Dr\nFauci\nAnd thank you, Sabrina, for that question.\nWhat we know is that where we have higher rates of infection among children is where we have lower rates of vaccination, in general \u2014 higher rates of community transmission.\nWe do know how to keep our children safe\nWe know how to do so in schools\nAnd we know that most of the infections that is coming in through \u2014 into schools is coming from high rates of disease in the community.\nSo, the best way to keep our schools safe \u2014 and we know how to do it \u2014 is to vaccinate everyone who can be vaccinated, vaccinate family members of children who cannot yet be vaccinated, and then to follow the mitigation strategies in our school guidance, including masking in schools.\nMR\nZIENTS: The one thing I\u2019d add there is, due to the passage of the American Rescue Plan several months ago, all schools have the resources to implement those mitigation strategies.\nNext question.\nMODERATOR: Josh Wingrove at Bloomberg.\nQ Hi, thank you\nCan you give us an update on the plan to start shipping those 500 million Pfizer doses that was meant to commence this month? Has that started? And what kind of pace will we see in the coming weeks? Thank you.\nMR\nZIENTS: Thanks, Josh\nThe 500 million Pfizer doses that were announced in June to be donated to the world \u2014 those shipments do begin this month, and we will ship a total of 200 million by the end of this year \u2014 this calendar year, with the remaining 300 million shipped no later than the first half of 2022\nSo, everything is on schedule there, Josh, and shipments are beginning in the next several days.\nNext question.\nMODERATOR: Next question\nLet\u2019s go to Weijia at CBS.\nQ Thanks, Kevin\nAnd thanks for taking my question\nMy \u2014 a quick follow-up on Sabrina\u2019s\nWhat is the latest data about children and long-haul symptoms after they recover even from mild cases?\nAnd then, Jeff, for you: Now that more entities are requiring vaccines, is the administration reconsidering something like a QR code or a passport to help verify people\u2019s vaccination status? And if not, what are you doing to stop the proliferation of fake vaccine cards? Thank you.\nMR\nZIENTS: Okay\nDr\nWalensky, on the children, long-COVID question.\nDR\nWALENSKY: Right\nThank you for that question.\nWe are examining long COVID in children, and we are seeing long-COVID symptoms \u2014 mostly fatigue and headache\nThey appear to be happening at rates that are lower than they are in adults \u2014 in the 2 to 3 percent\nBut, of course, data with Delta and long COVID will need to be followed differently and longitudinally as we have been with Alpha\nSo more data to follow on that.\nMR\nZIENTS: You know, on to vaccination verification: There are a number of ways people can demonstrate their vaccination status\nCompanies and organizations and the federal government are taking different approaches\nAnd, you know, we applaud this innovation.\nThere will be no federal vaccination database\nAs with all other vaccines, the information gets held at the state and local level\nBut any system that is developed, in the private sector or elsewhere, must meet key standards, including affordability, being available both digitally and on paper, and, importantly, protecting people\u2019s privacy and security.\nThe second part of your question \u2014 you know, we are aware of some cases of fraud or counterfeit COVID-19 cards being advertised on social media sites and eCommerce platforms\nWhile the practice is not widespread, you know, I will remind everyone that it\u2019s a crime and the Office of the Inspector General, the Department of Health and Human Services is investigating these schemes.\nNext question.\nMODERATOR: Cheyenne Haslett at ABC News.\nQ Hi, thanks for taking my question\nI want to follow up on a question from last week about the hospitalization rates for unvaccinated versus vaccinated people\nThe CDC has been saying it\u2019s 97 percent of people winding up in the hospital who are unvaccinated\nHas that number changed with Delta? And do you have better numbers on the efficacy, yet, Dr\nWalensky?\nDR\nWALENSKY: Thank you\nThat 97 percent was data from January through May \u2014 January, sorry, through June\nAnd, of course, with more and more people being vaccinated and with the Delta variant, those numbers are fluid, and we\u2019re continuing to evaluate those.\nNext question.\nMODERATOR: Let\u2019s go to Kelly Lienhard at Inside Health Policy.\nQ Hi, thanks for taking my question\nThere have been reports from CDC that over a million people have already gotten unauthorized third doses of mRNA vaccines\nDo you know if private insurances and Medicare are still covering the administration fee for these shots even though they\u2019re not recommended currently?\nMR\nZIENTS: Dr\nWalensky.\nDR\nWALENSKY: Yeah, we are doing an evaluation on that just to make sure and understand \u2014 and we have the capacity to track this and to understand the practice\nMany of these are occurring in the context of people who may believe they are \u2014 merit another shot, may be severely immunocompromised and are doing so in advance of our recommendations.\nThe one thing I want to highlight in the context of this is that it does undermine our ability to monitor safety in these contexts\nSo, we are asking people to follow our guidance, to follow what ACIP will say and the FDA will say in the coming day \u2014 several days, and to follow recommendations so we can we can follow safety signals here as well.\nNext question.\nMODERATOR: Last question\nLet\u2019s go to Michael Erman at Reuters.\nQ Hi\nDr\nFauci said this morning on an interview that he believes boosters, in general, are an inevitability\nI\u2019m just wondering how soon you expect that you might make a decision on that\nAnd what sort of data are you looking for to make that decision?\nDR\nFAUCI: Well, when I made that statement \u2014 it\u2019s a true statement that we believe, sooner or later, you will need a booster for durability of protection.\nRight now, you know, (inaudible), as we mentioned, we are evaluating this on a day-by-day, week-by-week, month-by-month basis, looking at any of a number of studies, both international and domestic studies\nAnd as we\u2019ve stated many times, right at this moment \u2014 apart from the immunocompromised, which was just discussed \u2014 we do not believe that others \u2014 elderly or nonelderly \u2014 who are not immunocompromised, need a vaccine right at this moment\nBut this is a dynamic process and the data will be evaluated.\nThe one thing we are doing is we are preparing for the eventuality of doing that\nSo, if the data shows us that in fact we do need to do that, we\u2019ll be very ready to do it and do it expeditiously.\nMR\nZIENTS: Yeah, I\u2019ll just emphasize what Dr\nFauci ended with, which is if and when there is a decision, we are prepared\nWe have the supply, and people will be able to get a booster in a fast and efficient way \u2014 if and when the science dictates.\nThank you\nAnd I look forward to seeing everybody at the next briefing.\n1:08 P.M\nEDT\nTo view the COVID Press Briefing slides, visit: https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/COVID-Press-Briefing_12August2021_for-transcript.pdf",
