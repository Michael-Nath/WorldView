What did you mean by those countries in the east of Germany? Are we standing in one of those? And secondly, NATO and especially you, you stood for not mirroring Russia's actions, aggressive actions\nHowever, some NATO officials have admitted officially that there may be a need for non-nuclear strategic offensive capabilities, long-range weapons deployed in Europe\nWith recent deployments of us so reactivation of the U.S\n56th Artillery Command in Europe and subsequent deployment hypersonic weapons, do you see that there's a contradiction to what you said about not mirroring actions? Or is this further NATO policy? And if I may just follow what the President said about Ukraine, because the Ukraine crisis is still developing; you said Mr\nSecretary General as well that if Russia uses force against Ukraine that will have costs, there will be consequences\nNow, the Ukrainians and friends of Ukrainians, and Allies is asking one simple question: what are those costs? What are those consequences that you have in mind? Have you discussed those today?\nNATO Secretary General\nFirst of all, we call on Russia to de-escalate, to be transparent because of the increased Russian presence close to Ukraine's borders is something which is very concerning for many reasons\nIt is also concerning because it is unprovoked and unexplained\nAnd what we see is a concentration of forces which is unusual\nWe see heavy weapons, we see armoured units, we see artillery, we see battle tanks, we see drones, we see also electronic warfare systems, and then we see tens of thousands of combat-ready troops\nSo the message to Russia is that they should de-escalate, reduce tensions, and be transparent\nThen we also send the message to Moscow about that, if they decide to use force, then of course, there will be consequences\nAnd we have demonstrated our will and our capability to impose costs and consequences on Russia before\nWe did that after the illegal annexation of Crimea back in 2014, where NATO Allies, the European Union, since then, have actually imposed heavy economic sanctions, financial sanctions on Russia\nAnd we have also since then implemented, implemented the biggest reinforcements of our collective defence since the end of the Cold War, with battle groups, for instance, in the Baltic region, Germany, and the battle group in Lithuania\nTomorrow I will visit the Canadian-led battle group in Latvia\nAnd we have battle groups in Poland and also Estonia\nWe have tripled the size of the NATO Response Force, and we have increased our presence in eastern part of the Alliance on land, in the air and at sea with air policing, with increased presence of NATO troops, and also with more naval presence\nSo we have demonstrated before our resolve to impose costs on Russia when they violate international law, violate the territorial integrity and sovereignty of a close partner of NATO, Ukraine\nThen on the question of\u2026 No, we will mirror what Russia does\nSo for instance, we have no intentions of deploying nuclear-capable missiles in Europe\nBut of course, we need to respond when we see Russia constantly violating arms control agreements that led to the demise of for instance, the INF Treaty that banned all intermediate-range weapon systems, when they test and deploy, new advanced nuclear-capable systems\nThen, of course, we need to make sure that we continue to have credible deterrence and defence in a changed security environment\nAnd therefore we are investing more, we are, we have modernized also the NATO command structure, and we have increased the readiness or forces\nWe are also improving air and missile defence systems\nWe are looking into also conventional capabilities\nAnd we will continue to also continue to work for arms control because the best thing would be if we could now stop this development where we see more and more new weapon systems being deployed by Russia but also by China, that poses a challenge to NATO allied countries\nThen on the nuclear sharing\nWell, that was part of a discussion in Germany before the new government presented its platform for the new incoming government in Germany\nNow, the new platform has been presented\nAnd in the new platform, it's clearly stated that Germany will continue to be part of nuclear sharing, and therefore this is not in any way an issue anymore\nI welcome that decision by the incoming German government.",

            "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s use of military force and hybrid warfare tactics in his country\u2019s immediate neighborhood and beyond has brought into question NATO\u2019s ability to defend its eastern border\nRussian hybrid warfare, with an increased focus on asymmetric and nontraditional military capabilities, has made it considerably more difficult for NATO to counter destabilization efforts, information operations, cyberattacks, disinformation, propaganda, and psychological operations\nSuch hybrid warfare represents a security challenge not just for the frontline Baltic States, but also for all of NATO.\nWhile significant steps have been taken to strengthen traditional capabilities on NATO\u2019s borders, the existing asymmetry between this conventional military strength and new hybrid threats needs to focus minds at both the national and Alliance level\nEven though Russia has yet to directly challenge its NATO neighbors, there are no borders in information and cyberspace\nMoreover, the very disinformation and propaganda tactics that Russia has tested in its near abroad and the Baltic States\u2014spreading such narratives as \u201cthe fragmented, failed Baltic States\u201d and an \u201caggressive NATO\u201d\u2014have also been used in the West to manipulate political and social perceptions, and to disinform, destabilize, and divide societies\nThis offensive penetrates nearly all levels of communication\u2014TV, social media, blogs, and fake news\u2014in a variety of forums and languages, turning them into subliminal modes of influence in liberal democracies.\nThese activities form an important part of Russian foreign policy and military doctrine, which, along with Moscow\u2019s inventory of soft power tools, are encompassed in the concept of \u201cRussian World\u201d (Russkiy Mir)\nThis concept claims that Russian-speakers have been separated by artificial borders and yearn to be united\nRusskiy Mir was institutionalized in 2007 with the establishment of the Russkiy Mir Foundation, which formally aims to promote Russian language, culture, and education worldwide, while actually systematically using it for agenda-setting and strengthening the \u201cnecessity\u201d of Russia for other countries.\nIn order to guarantee its citizens\u2019 security, stability, and continued prosperity, NATO must respond to these capabilities and practices\nThe main goal of hybrid warfare is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in states, public institutions, and international organizations\nResilience against such attacks requires identification of vulnerabilities and recognition that they can, are, and will be used against the Alliance.\nNATO faces a second challenge\nIts policy and working culture are biased toward deterrence, an emphasis that evolved in the context of the hard power (and nuclear) challenge of the Cold War\nIt is questionable, however, whether Russia\u2019s many unconventional threats can be deterred, at least by symmetrical means\nDefense becomes much more important in this context, and in cases where deterrence will still be appropriate, it will have to be asymmetrical, relying on Western strengths and Russian vulnerabilities to be effective\nThis challenge demands rigorous and systematic attention.\nIn all these respects, the centers of excellence established in Latvia and Estonia have an important role to play\nThe establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) in Tallinn and the Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence (StratCom COE) in Riga signified a move toward addressing hybrid threats.\nCurrently, however, only nine out of twenty-nine NATO allies participate in StratCom COE and only seventeen in CCD COE\nIn principle, these centers analyze threats to all NATO allies, and there is a need for direct participation and a unified approach to these initiatives\nAdditionally, while NATO invests in analysis and research, it must also use the conclusions drawn from the work done by, for example, StratCom COE\nThere is an urgent need to operationalize conclusions in the theoretical realm, and develop practical and concrete recommendations, action plans, and clearly articulated strategies.\nAdditionally, this new inventory of threats must be placed squarely on the domestic and public agenda, within the European Union (EU)\u2014as most NATO members are also EU members\u2014as much as NATO\nThis entails enhancing the capabilities of StratCom and CCD, and strengthening our cooperation with non-NATO institutions on the Baltic coast (such as the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats in Finland) to be able to develop integrated and joint responses\nFew allies have the capacity to individually counter the range of unconventional state-sponsored threats (which, we must not forget, include organized crime, sabotage, and other forms of direct action)\nGovernments must share knowledge and provide better dissemination of intelligence across the Alliance\nToo often a failure to share intelligence has inflicted harm on NATO\u2019s societies\nCommunication must become more active, indeed proactive, if NATO is to address these new threats.\nFinally, NATO needs to be more robust in exposing and challenging those who spread disinformation\nNATO must find ways to support the spread of independent and objective information, and counter fake narratives, reinforcing the work carried out by the EU disinformation task force (East StratCom)\nIt is important for NATO to learn from the historical experience of the Baltic States\u2014countries that were occupied by the USSR for nearly fifty years, are especially attuned to Russian propaganda, and are more resilient to disinformation\nFaced with hybrid warfare threats, these skills should be shared with other NATO member states.\nFor decades, NATO has been focused on hard power, failing to give information awareness and operations the attention they now urgently deserve\nHybrid warfare is now organic to all warfare, even to traditional hard power conflict\nFor Russia, the initial period of war has always been of prime importance, and today it is critical to achieve decisive strategic results before an adversary even recognizes that war has begun\nIt is time NATO realized that vulnerability and chaos are not only the product of destabilization efforts, but also the prelude to overt conflict\nNATO must operationalize what it knows and expand its knowledge of what it needs to know, to maintain security in this new environment\nWhether this will be accomplished more through the creation of new units and establishments, or better synergies among existing ones, deserves objective and dispassionate examination.\nRihards Kols is a member of Latvia\u2019s parliament (Saeima), deputy chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and a representative of the

            "content": "4:29 P.M\nEDT\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon\nLast week, I laid out what we need to do to beat the COVID-19 vi- \u2014 pandemic and the challenges posed by the Delta variant.\nThis is a very different variant than what we\u2019ve dealt with previously\nIt\u2019s highly transmissible, and it\u2019s causing a new wave of cases\nIt accounts for over 80 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the United States today\nExperts tell us that we\u2019re going to see these cases rise in the weeks ahead \u2014 a largely preventable tragedy that will get worse before it gets better.\nWhat\u2019s different about this surge from previous ones is we have the tools to prevent this rise in cases from shutting down\nour businesses, our schools, our society, as we saw what happened last year.\nAnd while cases are on the rise, it\u2019s important to note we\u2019ve not seen a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most areas of the country.\nThat\u2019s because 165 million Americans are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of the most vulnerable Americans \u2014 our seniors.\nThe best line of defense against the Delta vac- \u2014 the virus is the vaccine\nIt\u2019s as simple as that\nPeriod\nThe vaccine.\nI want to be crystal clear about what\u2019s happening in the country today: We have a pandemic of the unvaccinated.\nNow, I know there\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there, so here are the facts: If you\u2019re vaccinated, you are highly unlikely to get COVID-19\nAnd even if you do, the chances are you won\u2019t show any symptoms; and if you do, they\u2019ll most likely be very mild.\nVaccinated people almost never are hospitalized with COVID-19\nIn fact, according to one recent study, 95 percent of overall COVID-19 hospitalizations are among those not fully vaccinated.\nAnd the data shows that virtually all the cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19 are from the unvaccinated population.\nLast month, a study showed that over 99 percent of COVID-19 deaths have among \u2014 have been among the unvaccinated people\nNinety-nine percent.\nThat means, if you\u2019re unvaccinated, you are much more likely to, one, get COVID-19; two, get hospitalized; and, three, die if you get it.\nThis is a tragedy\nPeople are dying and will die who don\u2019t have to die\nThe data is absolutely clear: As I\u2019ve said, we have a pandemic of the unvaccinated.\nThink of it this way: A hundred and ninety-one million Americans have gotten at least one shot, including 70 percent of adults over the age of 18\nA hundred and sixty-five million Americans are fully vaccinated, but about ninety million Americans are eligible for vaccines and still haven\u2019t gotten their first shot.\nYou know, I think there\u2019s a clear link between the lowest-vaccinated \u2014 I know \u2014 I don\u2019t think, actually \u2014 the lowest-vaccinated states and the states with the highest case rates.\nThis past week, the most vaccinated state in America,\nVermont, has seen just five new cases \u2014 five \u2014 per day of COVID-19 for every 100,000 people who live in that state\nThat means, on any given day, only 30 people in the entire state of Vermont got COVID-19.\nNearby Maine, which has vaccinated almost 80 percent of their adults, has seen just six new cases per 100,000.\nBut the states with the lowest vaccination rates are seeing 10 to 20 times as many new cases per 100,000 people\nIt\u2019s moving like wildfire through the unvaccinated community\nAnd it\u2019s heartbreaking, particularly because it\u2019s preventable.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re doing everything we can to get more people vaccinated\nAnd we\u2019re seeing real results.\nIn the past two weeks, we have seen a 55 percent increase in the average number of new people getting vaccinated every day.\nIn the last seven days alone, nearly 3 million Americans have gotten their first shot\nThat\u2019s the highest seven-day total in a month.\nImportantly, over the past two weeks, the eight states with the highest current case rates have seen a doubling of the number of people newly vaccinated each day\nThe message is getting through, apparently.\nLouisiana has seen a 212 percent increase in the average number of newly vaccinated people in that state per day, going from 3,600 to over 11,000 people vaccinated per day.\nArkansas is up 99 percent\nMississippi is up 125 percent\nAlabama is up 186 percent \u2014 going from 3,200 to 9,150 people vaccinated per day\nThis will make a big difference.\nThese are encouraging signs\nWe have to continue our aggressive efforts to vaccinate the unvaccinated.\nLast week, I announced additional steps to incentivize Americans to get vaccinated, including calling on states to offer $100 for anyone willing to step up and get a vaccination shot.\nYou know, and already Minnesota and New Mexico have done that\nAnd North Carolina announced its 100-day incentive \u2014 its $100 incentive today.\nPlaces that have offered the hundred thou- \u2014 the hundred thousand \u2014 (laughs) \u2014 the hundred dollars \u2014 that\u2019d be really good\nI\u2019d go back and get vaccinated three times\n(Laughter.) But all kidding aside, offered the $100 to get vaccination have seen an uptick of 25 percent of daily vaccination rates.\nWe also announced that small- and medium-sized businesses will be fully reimbursed for offering paid time off for their employees to get vaccinated and for them to take a child or a parent to get vaccinated.\nAnd I announced some tough, sometimes unpopular steps to keep people safe and our economy strong\nAll federal workers must report their vaccination status or be subject to strict requirements\nAny federal worker who does not attest to their vaccination status or is not vaccinated will be required to mask no matter where they work, test one to twice a week, socially distance, and generally will not be allowed to travel for work.\nI directed my administration to take steps to apply similar standards to all federal contractors\nIf you want to do business with the federal government, get your workers vaccinated.\nAnd I also directed the Pentagon to look at adding COVID-19 to the list of vaccinations that are required for our troops because others are required.\nI approved the Department of Veterans Affairs to require doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers who care for our veterans to be vaccinated.\nAnd the good news is that now many are following the federal government\u2019s lead\nIn the past several days, states and local officials have come out to impose similar vaccination mandates.\nAnd the private sector is stepping up as well\nEven Fox has vaccination requirements\nI want to thank Walmart, Google, Netflix, Disney, Tyson Foods for their recent actions requiring vaccination for employees.\nLook, I know this isn\u2019t easy, but I will have their backs and the backs of other private and public sector leaders if they take such steps.\nBut others have declined to step up\nI find it disappointing\nAnd worst of all, some state officials are passing laws or signing orders that forbid people from doing the right thing.\nAs of now, seven states not only ban mask mandates, but also ban them in their school districts, even for young children who cannot get vaccinated\nSome states have even banned businesses and universities from requiring workers and students to be masked or vaccinated.\nAnd the most extreme of those measures is like the one in Texas that say state universities or community colleges could be fined if it allows a teacher to ask her unvaccinated students to wear a mask.\nWhat are we doing?\nCOVID-19 is a national challenge, and we must come together \u2014 we have to come together \u2014 all of us together, as a country, to solve it.\nMake no mistake: The les- \u2014 the exc- \u2014 ex- \u2014 excuse me \u2014 the escalation of cases is particularly concentrated in states with low vaccination rates\nJust two states, Florida and Texas, account for one third of all new COVID-19 cases in the entire country\nJust two states.\nLook, we need leadership from everyone\nAnd if some governors aren\u2019t willing to do the right thing to beat this pandemic, then they should allow businesses and universities who want to do the right thing to be able to do it.\nI say to these governors, \u201cPlease, help.\u201d But if you aren\u2019t going to help, at least get out of the way of the people who are trying to do the right thing\nUse your power to save lives.\nI\u2019ve made it our first and top priority to have a vaccine available for every single American from the day I got elected\nThat was my priority\nAnd let me be clear: We have a supply for every single American, and that will never change.\nAt the same time, it\u2019s also in our national interest to share some of our vaccines with the world, which gets me to the second thing I want to discuss today.\nFrom the beginning of my presidency, I\u2019ve been very clear-eyed that we need to attack this virus globally, not just at home, because it\u2019s in America\u2019s self-interest to do so.\nThe virus knows no boundaries\nYou can\u2019t build a wall high enough to keep it out\nThere is no wall high enough or ocean wide enough to keep us safe from a vaccination in other \u2014 from the COVID-19 in other countries.\nIn fact, just like the original virus that caused COVID-19, the Delta variant came from abroad\nAs long as the virus continue to rage outs- \u2014 rage outside the United States, potentially more dangerous variants could arrive at our shores again.\nAnd we know that COVID-19 in other countries stifles economic growth, disrupts supply chains, risks instability and weakness of governments\nAnd as we\u2019ve seen in the United States, the key to growing economies is to vaccinate people.\nSo just as the American economy is recovering, it\u2019s in all of our interests to have global \u2014 the global economy begin to recover as well.\nThis is about our values\nWe value inherent dignity of all people \u2014 the inherent dignity of everyone\nIn times of trouble, Americans reach out to offer a helping hand\nThat\u2019s who we are.\nAnd I\u2019ve said before: In this fight against COVID-19, the United States is committed to be the arsenal of vaccines, just as we were the arsenal of democracy during World War Two.\nAnd we\u2019re backing up that commitment\nWe have contributed more than any other nation to COVAX \u2014 the collective global efforts delivering COVID-19 vaccines across the world.\nWe have supported manufacturing efforts abroad through our partnerships with Japan, India, Australia \u2013- known as \u201cthe Quad.\u201d\nDuring my trip to Europe in June, I announced that the United States would purchase a groundbreaking 500 million doses of Pfizer and then donate them \u2014 those doses \u2014 nearly \u2014 to nearly a hundred low- and middle-income countries who don\u2019t have the vaccine\nThose doses will start to ship at the end of this month.\nWe also announced that we\u2019d donate 80 million doses of our own vaccine to supply the world, which has already begun.\nAnd today, I have an important update\nWe\u2019ve already exceeded 80 million doses that have been \u2014 gone out\nAs of today, the United States has shipped over 110 million doses of U.S\nvaccines to 65 countries that are among the hardest hit in the world.\nLet me say it again: As of today, we have shipped over 110 million doses to 65 nations.\nAccording to the United Nations, this is more than the donations of all 24 countries that have donated any vaccine to other countries, including China and Russia \u2014 all those nations combined.\nThese vaccine donations from America are free\nWe\u2019re not selling them\nThere are no demands, no conditions, no coercion attached\nAnd there is no favoritism and no strings attached\nWe\u2019re doing this to save lives and to end this pandemic\nThat\u2019s it.\nIn fact, we\u2019re donating vaccines to countries that have real issues \u2014 we have real issues with.\nAnd we\u2019ll continue to give tens of millions of the doses away across the summer and work to increase U.S\nmanufacturing and manufacturing of vaccines around the world as well.\nAnd it\u2019s not just vaccines\nWe are continuing to provide\ncountries with \u2014 in need \u2014 with more testing, protective equipment, and personnel to stem the surge of the virus\nWe\u2019ve done it in India and elsewhere.\nLet me close with this\nI\u2019ve said before: In the race for the 21st century between democracies and autocracies, we need to prove that democracies can deliver.\nAnd the democracies of the world are looking to America to lead again \u2014 in two ways\nFirst, to demonstrate we can control this virus at home\nAnd second, to show we can help address it around the world.\nVaccinate America and help vaccinate the world \u2014 that\u2019s how we\u2019re about to beat this thing.\nWe\u2019re always going to have enough doses for every American who wants one\nOur work in donating vaccines to the world is about America following through on our promises and delivering what we say we\u2019ll deliver.\nIt\u2019s showing how American science and technology, American businesses and academia, and our government can all work together.\nAbove all, it\u2019s proving democracies can deliver and, yet again, that America is back leading the world \u2014 not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.\nWe still have a lot of work to do\nSo if you\u2019re unvaccinated, please, please, please get the shot.\nBut just don\u2019t take it from me\nJust read the news\nListen to the voices of the unvaccinated patients in the hospital\nThey are spending [sending] the most powerful message to their families and everyone around the world \u2014 a powerful message to everybody\nAs they\u2019re lying in bed, many dying from COVID-19, they\u2019re asking, \u201cDoc, can I get the vaccine?\u201d The doctors have to look them in the eye and say, \u201cNo, sorry\nIt\u2019s too late.\u201d\nRight now, too many people are dying or watching a loved one dying and saying, \u201cIf I just got vaccinated\nIf I just\u2026\u201d\nFolks, this is isn\u2019t about politics\nThe virus doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re a Democrat or a Republican\nThis is about life and death\nLife and death.\nI can\u2019t say it any more plainly than this: The vaccine saves lives, and it could save yours or your child\u2019s.\nYou know, I know we can do this\nWe\u2019re the United States of America\nWe\u2019re prepared like never before\nWe have the tools and the resources to save lives at home and around the world.\nThis is who we are\nThis is what we do\nThis is why there\u2019s no nation like us on Earth.\nGod bless you all\nAnd may God protect our troops.\nAnd I\u2019ll take a few questions.\nQ Mr\nPresident, I have a question for you on coronavirus, but first I\u2019d like to start with the news of the day \u2014 given, back in March, you said that if the investigation confirmed the allegations against Governor Cuomo, then he should resign\nSo, will you now call on him to resign, given the investigators said the 11 women were credible?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I stand by that statement.\nQ Are you now calling on him to resign?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes.\nQ And if he doesn\u2019t resign, do you believe he should be impeached and removed from office?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Let\u2019s take one thing at a time here\nI think he should resign.\nQ Do you think \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT: I understand that the state legislature may decide to impeach\nI don\u2019t know that for a fact; I\u2019ve not read all that data.\nQ And he\u2019s using a photo of you embracing him in his self-defense to say that these are commonplace kind of embraces that he made in the allegations against him\nDo you condone that?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Look, I\u2019m not going to flyspeck this\nI\u2019m sure there are some embraces that were totally innocent, but app- \u2014 apparently, the Attorney General decided there were things that weren\u2019t.\nQ And on coronavirus, if I could ask you a question about the evictions.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Why don\u2019t you come up and take the platform? (Laughter.)\nQ No, thank you.\nOn the evictions and the moratorium that lapsed on Saturday night: What is your strategy to prevent potentially millions of people from being evicted from their homes, given what we are told your administration is considering \u2014 a targeted moratorium \u2014 is likely to face legal challenges?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Any call for a moratorium based on the Supreme Court recent decision is likely to face obstacles\nI\u2019ve indicated to the CDC I\u2019d like them to look at other alternatives than the one that is in pow- \u2014 in existence, which the Court has declared they\u2019re not going to allow to continue\nAnd the CDC will have something to announce to you in the next hour to two hours.\nQ Thank you.\nQ President Biden, on overseas coronavirus vaccines: Should other high-income countries follow the lead of the United States and increase donations to low- and middle-income countries?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I think those countries that have been able to cover their population and have the ability to provide either dollars and/or vaccine for the 100 or so na- \u2014 poor nations that need help should do so\nWe had that discussion at the G7\nA number of those countries said they were going to do that\nSome have followed through.\nThe point I was making is, though, I\u2019ve kept the commitment \u2014 we\u2019ve kept the commitment that we would do what we said, which is more than all the rest of the countries combined thus far.\nQ Mr\nPresident, do you believe that Governor DeSantis and Governor Abbott are personally making decisions that are harming their own citizens?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I believe the results of their decisions are not good for their constituents\nAnd it\u2019s clear to me and to most of the medical experts that the decisions being made, like not allowing mask mandates in school and the like, are bad health policy \u2014 bad health policy.\nQ Mr\nPresident, I have a question about something that you just said.\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m sure you do.\nQ Thank you\nYou just said there is no wall high enough and no ocean wide enough to protect us from the virus\nSo what is the thinking behind letting untested and unvaccinated migrants cross the southern border into U.S\ncities in record numbers?\nTHE PRESIDENT: There is \u2014 what we\u2019re doing \u2014 we have not withdrawn the order that is sometimes critical \u2014 criticized \u2014 saying that unvaccinated people should be \u2014 go back across the border.\nBut unaccompanied children is a different story, because there\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the most humane thing to do is to test them and to treat them and not send them back alone.\nQ Mr\nPresident, have you spoken with Governor Cuomo today?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I have not.\nQ And then one other question on the virus\nYou just said we have \u2014 we have to continue our aggressive efforts to get the unvaccinated vaccinated\nOther countries have found a lot of success in requiring vaccines in public places\nNew York City just announced today that they\u2019ll require vaccines for restaurants and gyms\nDo you think more cities and states should institute rules like that?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I do.\nQ And are you going to publicly call on them? Should they institute a vaccine passport-type system, or it\u2019s up to each city and state to figure that out on their own?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m sorry\nWhat did you say?\nQ Do you think that they should institute a vaccine passport-type system or some sort of verification to use public spaces?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t think they need to do that\nI think they just need to give the authority of those restaurants or businesses to say, \u201cIn order to come in, you have to give proof that you\u2019ve been vaccinated or you can\u2019t come in.\u201d\nI\u2019ll take a couple more.\nQ Mr\nPresident can I ask you about news of the day \u2014 one more on Governor Cuomo? You\u2019re calling for him to resign now\nMy question is: Do you think he should be prosecuted? And what is your message to the women who have now accused him of sexually harassing them and abusing them?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Look, what I said was: If the investigation of the Attorney General concluded that the allegations were correct, that \u2014 back in March \u2014 that I would recommend he resign\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m doing today\nI\u2019ve not read the report\nI don\u2019t know the detail of it\nAll I know is the end result.\nQ Mr\nPresident, a question on COVID, if I could, really quickly\nIt\u2019s the eviction moratorium\nCan you explain a little bit more why it took so long to have a possible eviction moratorium be put into place? There was \u2014 there are people \u2014 this expired on Saturday\nI\u2019m wondering \u2014 there are folks who are saying it took too long for this to happen.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the courts made it clear that the existing moratorium was not constitutional; it wouldn\u2019t stand\nAnd they made that clear back in, I guess, July 15th or July 18th.\nIn the meantime, what I\u2019ve been pushing for and calling for is we have billions of dollars that were given to states to provide for rent and utilities for those people who can\u2019t afford to stay in their homes because they can\u2019t \u2014 an apartment \u2014 they can\u2019t pay their rent\nAnd so, we\u2019re urging them to distribute those funds to the landlords\nI believe that would take care of the vast majority of what needs to be done to keep people in their \u2014 in their ho- \u2014 in their apartments now.\nAnd so that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on\nSome states have done it and some communities have, but they have not\nThe money is there\nIt\u2019s not \u2014 we don\u2019t have to send it out\nIt\u2019s been sent out to the states and counties \u2014 billions of dollars \u2014 for the express purpose of providing for back rent and rent for the people who are in the middle of this crisis\nAnd that\u2019s there; that\u2019s what we\u2019re pushing now\nAnd we\u2019ve been pushing that\nThat\u2019s the immediate thing to do.\nI\u2019ll take one more question.\nQ Mr\nPresident, thank you so much\nThere was an expectation that you would be announcing new vaccines to the world today \u2014 a new \u2014 other than the ones you promised\nAre you ready to send more vaccines to the world?\nAnd there is a delegation from the White House going to Brazil tomorrow\nAre they bringing more vaccines? Are they announcing more vaccines to Brazil?\nTHE PRESIDENT: No \u2014 are they announcing more vaccines overall?\nQ Overall\nAnd then to Brazil \u2014 for the delegation coming to Brazil tomorrow \u2014 will you be bringing vaccines?\nTHE PRESIDENT: The answer is: I don\u2019t know whether the delegation going physically has vaccines with them\nWe have provided vaccines to \u2014\nQ Are they bringing the announcement? Are they announcing there?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, no, there\u2019s a need for several billion doses around the world\nWe have committed to over a half a billion doses\nAnd we\u2019re trying to provide for more and provide for the capacity of countries like India to be able to produce the vaccine themselves\nAnd we\u2019re helping them do that\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now.\nAnd we\u2019re trying to \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 and, by the way, it\u2019s free\nWe\u2019re not charging anybody anything\nAnd we\u2019re trying to do as much as we possibly can.\nThank you all very much.\nQ Mr\nPresident, we\u2019re learning that your administration is about to announce a new partial eviction moratorium, COVID related\nCan you tell us any more about that? And are you sure it\u2019s going to pass Supreme Court muster?\nTHE PRESIDENT: The answer is twofold\nOne, I\u2019ve sought out constitutional scholars to determine what is the best possibility that would come from executive action, or the CDC\u2019s judgment, what could they do that was most likely to pass muster, constitutionally.\nThe bulk of the constitutional scholarship says that it\u2019s not likely to pass constitutional muster\nNumber one\nBut there are several key scholars who think that it may and it\u2019s worth the effort\nBut the present \u2014 you could not \u2014 the Court has already ruled on the present eviction moratorium.\nSo I think what you\u2019re going to see, and I \u2014 look, I want to make it clear: I told you I would not tell the Justice Department or the medical experts, the scientists what they should say or do\nSo I don\u2019t want to get ahead.\nThe CDC has to make the \u2014 I asked the CDC to go back and consider other options that may be available to them\nYou\u2019re going to hear from them what those other options are.\nI have been informed they\u2019re about to make a judgment as to potential other options\nWhether that option will pass constitutional measure with this administration, I can\u2019t tell you\nI don\u2019t know\nThere are a few scholars who say it will and others who say it\u2019s not likely to.\nBut, at a minimum, by the time it gets litigated, it will probably give some additional time while we\u2019re getting that $45 billion out to people who are, in fact, behind in the rent and don\u2019t have the money\nThat\u2019s why it was passed in \u2014 in the act that we passed in the beginning of my administration, and it went to the states.\nWe were under the impression that the states were moving this money out relatively rapidly\nSo, for example, if I\u2019m in an apartment \u2014 if you\u2019re in an apartment, and you\u2019re behind on four- or five-month\u2019s rent, and let\u2019s say your rent is $2,000 a month \u2014 I\u2019m just making this up out of the blue \u2014 and you\u2019re behind, you need $10,000 to catch up\nHardly anybody has that $10,000\nBut there is money that the states have that can give to the landlord that $10,000 to the back rent.\nThe future rent, it\u2019s unlikely \u2014 at least the hope is, since they have been made whole to that point \u2014 that they\u2019d be inclined \u2014 because the economy is growing \u2014 inclined not to throw someone out in the street; keep that person \u2014 no guarantee \u2014 keep that person in the apartment, keep these kids in the same school district, and count on being able to have the opportunity for that \u2014 that person to be able \u2014 who may now be employed \u2014 to pay their rent.\nBut in the meantime, I\u2019ve asked, isn\u2019t there any safety valve we can put in? And it\u2019s the one I explained to you\nAgain, CDC will announce that and the details of exactly how it works\nI\u2019m not telling \u2014 I told them I want them to take a look\nI didn\u2019t tell them what they had to do.\nAnd my hope is, it\u2019s going to be a new moratorium that in some way \u2014 and I\u2019m not going to announce it now; I\u2019ll let them announce it \u2014 in some way covers close to 90 percent of the American people who are renters\nAnd so that\u2019s all I can tell you now.\nThank you very much.\nQ Why not 100 percent? What\u2019s the difference?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Because it\u2019s a \u2014 (laughs) \u2014 let them explain that to you\nOkay? I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead.\nThank you.\nQ Mr\nPresident, is COVAX doing enough to get shots in arms?\nQ Why not call Governor DeSantis, Mr\nPresident?\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) To say \u201chappy birthday\u201d? What? I mean \u2014\nQ To deliver the message that you seem to be delivering today about \u201cget out of the way.\u201d\nTHE PRESIDENT: He knows the message\nHe knows the message\nWe had a little discussion when I was down there\nHe knows the message.\nQ What did he say to you in that discussion?\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) See you all later.\n5:00 P.M\nEDT",
